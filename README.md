# SMART-MEDICINE-BOX-SYSTEM

SMART-MEDICINE-BOX-SYSTEM is a purely microcontroller-based device meant for old-aged people who are living in their homes alone. As per the reports, In the modern world, the number of senior citizens living alone is increasing at a faster rate. So due to old age difficulties, some may forget to take medicine on time and it causes severe health problems. Existing internet-based reminder systems can be manipulated easily and it may cause irregularities in the intaking of medicines and thereby risks the lives of our senior citizens. So we designed a circuit that alerts the person at the time when he/she has to take the medicine and the robotic arm dispenses the medicine from the medicine box to the compartment from where the person can take the medicine. Our circuit mainly consists of Arduino mega 2560 microcontroller, RTC module, LCD screen, push button, buzzer, and robotic arm.
